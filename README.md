# Angular 10 with Bootstrap - Role Based Authorization Example

An example of how to implement role based authorization / access control in Angular 10. Using JWT authentication with refresh tokens and a fake backend.

There are three pages - a login page, a home page and an admin page. There are two roles - a regular user (Role.User) that can access the home page, and an admin user (Role.Admin) that can access everything.

# Building the client

## Used technologies and components
* For styling: [Bootstrap 4.5 CSS](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/)

## Project structure

Start a new Angular 10 project with routing module:
```shell
$ ng new ng-bootstrap-role-based-auth-client
```

The `index.ts` files in each folder are barrel files that group the exported modules from a folder together so they can be imported using the folder path rather than the full module path, and to enable importing multiple modules in a single import (e.g. `import { AuthenticationService, UserService } from '../_services'`).

Path aliases `@app` and `@environments` have been configured in `tsconfig.base.json` that map to the `/src/app` and `/src/environments` directories. This allows imports to be relative to the app and environments folders by prefixing import paths with aliases instead of having to use long relative paths (e.g. `import MyComponent from '../../../MyComponent'`).

## TypeScript tsconfig.json

**Path: /tsconfig.json**

The paths property has been added to map the `@app` and `@environments` aliases to the `/src/app` and `/src/environments` directories. This allows imports to be relative to the app and environments folders by prefixing import paths with aliases instead of having to use long relative paths (e.g. `import MyComponent from '@app/MyComponent'` instead of `import MyComponent from '../../../MyComponent'`).
